### Meeting July 28th


&rarr; Participants: Andreas, Cédric, Michael & Saleh

**Ideas:**

* Urban agriculture *(Saleh)*
* Green spaces (#/area) in Berlin *(Michael)*
* Bike lanes and car accidents *(Andreas)*
* Living versus non-living space & rental prices *(Cédric)*
* (Movement of young people to Berlin (East/West))
* (East/West comparison in general)


**Next steps:**

* **Explore the datasets in more detail via `datenguidepy`** (own Rmd script, Jupyter notebook, Laras or Cédric's scripts...)
* **Search for additional resources** (one requirement—or a "nice-tohave"—acoording to the rules are external data)
* **Check news, articles, studies on that topic** for...
  + interesting findings/patterns/stories in other cities
  + detailed reports for Berlin on the same topic (might either help or let's us discard the idea)
